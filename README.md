The site is deployed as **[Potential Jammming](https://potentialjammming.surge.sh/)**, to Surge.


In this app you can choose your favorite songs from Spotify and create your own playlists, then you can export them to your Spotify account; it includes the following **Potential Features** (all of them are comment to help other developers learning):

- Pressing enter in the search bar triggers a search.
- Include preview samples for each track.
- Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results.
- Add a loading screen while playlist is saving.
- Update the access token logic to expire at exactly the right time, instead of setting expiration from when the user initiates their next search.
- After user redirect on login, restoring the search term from before the redirect.
- Ensure playlist information doesnâ€™t get cleared if a user has to refresh their access token.
